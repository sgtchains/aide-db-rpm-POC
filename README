This was a proof of concept that went no where.  It was only a proof of concept and 
NEEDS actual development work before it can be implemented.  Of note is how it accesses 
the local RPM database is not how this should be done.

OPERATION

The fim-report script only needs to be installed on a single host, it is the tool that 
is used to approve changes and also provides nagios monitoring via the --nagios flag.

aide-parser and rpm-parser should be run via root's cron, at least once a day, perhaps
as often as six times a day.  The aide-parse script expects that a new aide.db has been
created, and does not look for local copies of the aide database.  Also aide is prelink
aware, so it is advise to to run perlink before running 'aide -i'.  An example for cron;
0 * * * * /etc/cron.daily/prelink && /usr/sbin/aide -i && /usr/local/sbin/aide-parser /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz

rpm-parser uses the installed rpm tools to dump objects and pushes them into the database.
Example cron;
10 * * * * /usr/local/sbin/rpm-parser

fim-report is the tool used for reporting changes and approving them, it does not need 
to be installed on every host.  This script coalesces changes based on all changes seen.
In other words, updating a RPM package will only report that the RPM has changed even though 
it has installed scores of files that aide is now reporting as having changed.  It will also 
review what aide is reporting on is what the RPM layed down.

fim-report has two modes of operation '--nagios' and '--interactive'
It is expected that 'nagios' be used for system monitoring from a central host and 
'interactive' is used to approve changes.
 

TODO:

* Would be nice to get puppet to report changes and coalesce them.
* Web interface for a pretty UI.
